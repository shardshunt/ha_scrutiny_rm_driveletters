# Scrutiny Home Assistant integration

This Home Assistant integration allows you to monitor the health and S.M.A.R.T. data of your hard drives by fetching information from a local Scrutiny instance.

Scrutiny can run as Docker-Container on your server or NAS and you can find the installation guide in the official repository:

#### https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny

- Creates Home Assistant sensor entities for each disk, displaying:
Overall device status
- Temperature
- Power-on hours
- Power cycle count
- Disk capacity
- Overall S.M.A.R.T. test result
